    <h1>About Alison</h1>
    <p>A big passion of mine is digital art. I specialize in drawing fantasy artwork and animals, and I take art commissions when I have the time.
        Whilst rewarding, digital art can be extremely time consuming, and it can be difficult to accurately estimate
    how much time detailed projects will take. My most recent project is sitting at 25 hours of work but will likely require another
    10 hours of work until being ready to present to the client. Luckily, you can expedite the art process by practicing often and solidifying
    the techniques used for each part of the process. In my art process I have about 7 steps: sketching, sketch refinement, lineart, background,
    color, shading, and lighting and final details. </p>
