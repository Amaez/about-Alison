    <h1>About Alison</h1>

    <p>A big passion of mine is digital art. I specialize in drawing fantasy artwork and animals, and I take art commissions when I have the time.</p>
    <p>While being an extremely rewarding hobby, digital art can be surprisingly time consuming. It can be difficult to estimate accurately
    how much time a detailed project will take. </p>
    <p>My most recent project is currently sitting at 25 hours of work, but will likely require another
    10 hours of work until being ready to present to the client. Luckily, you can expedite the art process by practicing daily and solidifying
    the techniques you use for each step of your process. </p>
    <p>In my art process I have about 7 steps: sketching, sketch refinement, lining, background,
    color, shading, and lighting/final details. </p>
